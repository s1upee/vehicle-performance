# 🚗 Vehicle Performance Data Acquisition System

## 📌 Project Status: In Progress 🚀
I have just started working on this project, and it is currently in the development phase. Stay tuned for updates as I build out the system!  

---

## 📚 Overview
This project aims to develop a **Vehicle Performance Data Acquisition System** that collects and analyzes real-time driving data, focusing on acceleration, braking force, steering input, and ADAS event detection.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/s1upee/vehicle-performance.git
cd vehicle-performance
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Run Data Simulation
Generate synthetic vehicle performance data:
```bash
python src/data_simulation.py
```

### 3️⃣ Process & Analyze Data
Detect anomalies and process collected data:
```bash
python src/data_processing.py
```

### 4️⃣ Visualize Data
Generate plots for acceleration, braking, and steering trends:
```bash
python src/visualization.py
```

### 5️⃣ Start Dashboard (Optional)
Run an interactive dashboard for real-time analysis:
```bash
python src/dashboard.py
```
